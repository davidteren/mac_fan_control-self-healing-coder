# Knowledge Base

## Purpose
This file serves as the core knowledge repository for Open Interpreter, containing validated patterns, solutions, and learnings that have proven effective over time.

## Current Knowledge Base

### Patterns
#### State Persistence Patterns
- Save conversation state after each significant action
- Include timestamp, current task, and progress
- Maintain context for recovery from interruptions
- Store next steps for continuation
- Regular state file cleanup for outdated entries

```python
# Example state management pattern
def manage_conversation_state(action='get', **state_updates):
    state_file = '.project/state/conversation_state.json'
    if action == 'get':
        try:
            with open(state_file, 'r') as f:
                return json.load(f)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            return None
    elif action == 'update':
        current_state = manage_conversation_state('get') or {}
        current_state.update(state_updates)
        current_state['timestamp'] = datetime.now().isoformat()
        with open(state_file, 'w') as f:
            json.dump(current_state, f, indent=2)
```


#### Interaction Patterns
- Always start by checking .project_guide
- Validate file existence before operations
- Use incremental steps for complex operations
- Preview changes before making them permanent

#### Error Handling Patterns
- Capture and log all errors
- Implement try-except blocks for file operations
- Verify system state before and after operations
- Roll back changes on failure when possible

#### Code Execution Patterns
- Break complex operations into smaller, verifiable steps
- Validate inputs before processing
- Provide progress feedback for long-running operations
- Maintain state consistency across operations

### Solutions

#### File Operations
```python
def safe_file_operation(file_path, operation):
    try:
        if os.path.exists(file_path):
            return operation(file_path)
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return False
```

#### State Management
```python
def get_system_state():
    return {
        'files': list_project_files(),
        'last_modified': get_last_modified_times(),
        'status': check_system_status()
    }
```

### Best Practices
- Document all significant changes
- Maintain consistent error handling
- Provide clear feedback for operations
- Keep atomic commits for version control
- Regular backup of critical files
