# Work in Progress

## Purpose
This document tracks current experiments, temporary solutions, and improvements being tested by Open Interpreter.

## Active Improvements

### Current Experiments

#### 3. Conversation State Persistence
Status: Critical Need
Description: System for maintaining conversation context across sessions
Goals:
- Persist conversation state across interruptions
- Track current task and progress
- Enable recovery from exceptions
Implementation Plan:
```python
def save_conversation_state(state):
    state_data = {
        'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),
        'current_task': state.get('current_task'),
        'progress': state.get('progress'),
        'context': state.get('context'),
        'next_steps': state.get('next_steps')
    }
    with open('.project/state/conversation_state.json', 'w') as f:
        json.dump(state_data, f, indent=2)

def load_conversation_state():
    try:
        with open('.project/state/conversation_state.json', 'r') as f:
            return json.load(f)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return None
```
Next Steps:
- [ ] Implement conversation state tracking
- [ ] Add automatic state saving on exceptions
- [ ] Create recovery mechanism for interrupted tasks
- [ ] Add state summary to beginning of each session



#### 1. Enhanced Error Logging
Status: In Progress
Description: Implementing comprehensive error logging system
Metrics:
- Error capture rate
- Resolution time
- Pattern identification
Next Steps:
- [ ] Implement logging framework
- [ ] Test with various error types
- [ ] Analyze effectiveness

#### 2. Automated State Management
Status: Planning
Description: System for tracking and managing application state
Goals:
- Consistent state tracking
- Automated recovery
- State history maintenance
Next Steps:
- [ ] Design state structure
- [ ] Implement basic tracking
- [ ] Test recovery mechanisms

### Temporary Solutions

#### 1. File Operation Wrapper
Status: Under Review
Implementation:
```python
def safe_file_op(path, op):
    try:
        return op(path)
    except Exception as e:
        log_error(e)
        return None
```
Notes:
- Currently in testing
- Needs error categorization
- Consider adding retry mechanism

#### 2. State Verification
Status: Testing
Implementation:
```python
def verify_state():
    current = get_current_state()
    expected = load_expected_state()
    return compare_states(current, expected)
```
Notes:
- Basic implementation
- Needs enhancement for complex states
- Consider adding recovery options
