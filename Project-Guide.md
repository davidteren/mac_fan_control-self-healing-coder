# Project Guide

## Purpose

This project enhances the capabilities of Open Interpreter by providing a dynamic knowledge base for self-healing and continuous improvement. It establishes a structured framework where the interpreter can:

- Learn from past interactions
- Improve decision-making processes
- Maintain consistent behavior patterns
- Autonomously correct errors
- Build upon successful patterns and solutions

## Project Structure

### Documentation Files (`.project/docs/`)

1. **`knowledge.md`**
   - **Purpose:** Core knowledge repository
   - **Contains:** Validated patterns, solutions, and learnings that have proven effective over time
   - **Self-Healing:** Updates with new validated knowledge; outdated information is removed to ensure relevance

2. **`processes.md`**
   - **Purpose:** Workflow and decision-making guidelines
   - **Contains:** Step-by-step procedures and best practices
   - **Self-Healing:** Refines processes based on outcomes to maintain consistency and effectiveness

3. **`wip.md`**
   - **Purpose:** Tracks current experiments, temporary solutions, and improvements in progress
   - **Contains:** Active developments and improvements being tested
   - **Self-Healing:** Regular review of experiments; successful approaches are promoted to permanent knowledge

### Scripts (`.project/scripts/`)

1. **`README.md`**
   - **Purpose:** Script documentation and usage guidelines
   - **Contains:** Implementation details and execution patterns for automation capabilities
   - **Self-Healing:** Updates with new automation patterns and contributes to the self-healing mechanism

## Self-Healing Mechanism

### Interaction Protocol

1. **Initial Interaction:**
   - Reference this guide for consistent behavior
   - Review `knowledge.md` for relevant patterns
   - Check `wip.md` for ongoing experiments
   - Validate system state before proceeding
   - Plan the approach using documented patterns

2. **Post-Interaction:**
   - Document new learnings or successful solutions
   - Update relevant files (`knowledge.md`, `processes.md`, `wip.md`)
   - Engage in the self-healing cycle by regularly updating the documentation

### Continuous Improvement

- Regular review of `wip.md` items
- Recognition of successful patterns in solutions
- Integration of new knowledge into core processes
- Refinement and validation of existing documentation to maintain accuracy

## Usage Instructions for Open Interpreter

1. **Always check this guide first for the latest guidelines.**
2. **Follow documented processes in `processes.md`.**
3. **Reference `knowledge.md` for proven solutions.**
4. **Consult `wip.md` for experimental approaches that may be relevant.**
5. **Maintain the self-healing cycle through documentation updates.**

## Goals

- **Learning from Past Interactions:** Building a comprehensive knowledge base that informs future decisions
- **Improving Decision-Making Processes:** Enhancing the ability to choose effective strategies through structured guidelines
- **Maintaining Consistent Behavior Patterns:** Ensuring reliability and predictability in performance by adhering to established processes
- **Self-Healing Through Error Recognition and Correction:** Autonomously identifying and correcting errors by updating the knowledge base
- **Building Upon Successful Patterns and Solutions:** Integrating proven approaches into core processes to promote continuous improvement
