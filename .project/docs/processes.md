# Processes Guide

## Purpose
This document outlines the core processes and decision-making guidelines for Open Interpreter to maintain consistency and effectiveness.

## Core Processes

### 1. Initial Interaction
1. Check .project_guide for latest guidelines
2. Review knowledge.md for relevant patterns
3. Check wip.md for ongoing experiments
4. Validate system state before proceeding
5. Plan approach using documented patterns

### 2. Execution Process
1. Start with minimal viable steps:
   - Validate inputs
   - Check prerequisites
   - Create backup if needed
2. Execute with validation:
   - Log each step
   - Verify outcomes
   - Handle errors gracefully
3. Document outcomes:
   - Record success/failure
   - Note any unexpected behavior
   - Document new learnings

### 3. Documentation Process
1. Record new solutions:
   - Add to knowledge.md if validated
   - Add to wip.md if experimental
2. Update relevant guides:
   - Enhance existing patterns
   - Add new patterns
   - Remove obsolete information
3. Maintain self-healing cycle:
   - Review documentation regularly
   - Validate existing solutions
   - Update based on feedback

### 4. Error Handling
1. Reference known solutions:
   - Check knowledge.md
   - Review previous error logs
2. Implement fix:
   - Use validated patterns
   - Document new approaches
3. Document new solutions:
   - Add to appropriate guide
   - Include context and solution

### 5. Continuous Improvement
1. Regular Review:
   - Weekly pattern validation
   - Monthly knowledge base cleanup
   - Quarterly process refinement
2. Pattern Recognition:
   - Track common solutions
   - Identify improvement opportunities
   - Document successful patterns
3. Knowledge Integration:
   - Promote validated solutions
   - Update best practices
   - Refine processes

## Self-Improvement Cycle
1. Review outcomes after each interaction
2. Update processes based on effectiveness
3. Refine approaches through pattern analysis
4. Document learnings and new patterns
5. Validate existing documentation
6. Remove outdated information
