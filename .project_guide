# Open Interpreter Project Guide

This guide and its referenced files serve as a dynamic knowledge base to enhance Open Interpreter's capabilities for self-healing and continuous improvement.

## Purpose
The files in this project structure are designed to organically evolve and guide Open Interpreter in:
- Learning from past interactions
- Improving decision-making processes
- Maintaining consistent behavior patterns
- Self-healing through error recognition and correction
- Building upon successful patterns and solutions

## Project Files Structure

### Documentation Files (.project/docs/)

1. knowledge.md
   - Purpose: Core knowledge repository
   - Contains: Learnings, patterns, and successful solutions
   - Self-healing: Updates with new validated knowledge

2. processes.md
   - Purpose: Workflow and decision-making guidelines
   - Contains: Step-by-step procedures and best practices
   - Self-healing: Refines processes based on outcomes

3. wip.md
   - Purpose: Active development and temporary solutions
   - Contains: Current experiments and improvements in progress
   - Self-healing: Regular review and promotion to permanent knowledge

### Scripts (.project/scripts/)

1. README.md
   - Purpose: Script documentation and usage guidelines
   - Contains: Implementation details and execution patterns
   - Self-healing: Updates with new automation patterns

## Self-Healing Mechanism

1. Each interaction should:
   - Reference these guides for consistent behavior
   - Document new learnings in appropriate files
   - Update processes based on outcomes
   - Move validated solutions from WIP to permanent knowledge

2. Continuous Improvement:
   - Regular review of WIP items
   - Pattern recognition in successful solutions
   - Integration of new knowledge into core processes
   - Refinement of existing documentation

## Usage Instructions for Open Interpreter

1. Always check this guide first
2. Follow documented processes
3. Document new solutions
4. Update relevant files after successful interactions
5. Maintain self-healing cycle through documentation updates
